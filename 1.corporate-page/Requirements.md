# Corporate Landing Page

## Brief

To be completed by a team of 2-3 people.

Using HTML and CSS, create a single-page website that serves as the landing page for a fictional corporation taken from other media (e.g. Vault-Tec from the Fallout series of videogames, the Tyrell Corporation from Blade Runner, Weyland-Yutani from Alien, Omni Consumer Products from Robocop, etc. Yes, these are all pretty evil science-fiction corporations, but you can choose something else of course!). The landing page should focus on aesthetics and not content – the only text might be the corporation’s name, for example. Instead, you should work to push the boundaries of the aesthetics of HTML/CSS specifically to create an  interpretation of the nature of the corporation in question.

For example, you might choose to represent the company Lacuna, Inc from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by having a webpage on which all the content fades away whenever the user seeks to interact with it by, say, hovering the mouse over it.

## Process

Always keep track of your design process and most especially keep track of the specific design and aesthetic decisions you make. You will need to be able to justify the aesthetic choices you make in terms of how they contribute to your page’s interpretation and presentation of the corporation chosen.

Importantly, you should document your process with photos, videos, drawings, diagrams, notes, etc. and by keeping copies of earlier prototypes to help explain your design and creation work - it’s easy to forget what you did otherwise! Equally importantly, you will be expected to be able to show your process during presentations, so you’ll need something to show!

## In class presentation

You will present your homepage in class on Friday the 23rd of September. To prepare for your presentation you should be ready to speak about all elements indicated in the grading rubric (see below), notably the concept, technical elements, aesthetics, and process of your work. Specifically, you should shape your presentation in response to the question:

How do HTML and CSS shape the aesthetic possibilities of web design?

To support your answer, you will make use of the submission itself along with supporting process materials. This will mean that you should:

    present the webpage itself, talking about the aesthetic and design decisions made and how they relate to the question.
    be able to refer to elements of the coding of the page that you think are particularly interesting in relation to the brief.
    be able to present process documentation that sheds light on how you got from your early ideas to the finished product.

Your presentation should be approximately 5 minutes long. Excessively short or long presentations will lose a grade point.

Remember:

    Make sure your page is online so that you can quickly navigate to it for the class.
    Make sure your HTML/CSS is easily available either by showing it in the developer tools of Chrome or by having it on a USB key or online so that you can quickly open it for the class to see.
    Make sure your process documentation is available either online or on your USB so you can quickly show relevant material to the class.


## Online submission

You should submit the following on the class Moodle on this assignment page by 11:59PM on Friday the 23rd of September:
 
One team member should submit a text containing:

    The names of your team members and the corporation being represented.
    A link to the web page produced (e.g. on your personal web space)
    A link to the web page’s source files as a .zip file (e.g. on your personal web space, Dropbox, etc.)
    A link to the project’s process files as a .zip file, online directory, or webpage (e.g. on your personal web space, Dropbox, etc.)


(Only one member of any given team needs to submit the assignment.)

All team members should submit a text containing a brief personal evaluation of each team member’s contribution to the project, writing names (including their own) and ratings from 0 (completely unhelpful) to 5 (full participation and contribution), along with any clarifying comments deemed necessary.

## Grading

This assignment is worth 5% of your final grade. It will be graded according to the following rubric:

### Concept.
An exemplary project will:

    have a creative and unusual way of addressing the project brief through conceptualisation and design
    demonstrate an ambitious and experimental approach to HTML/CSS that emphasises and enhances the project brief
    raise substantive questions and ideas about the underlying subject matter for the user


### Technical.
An exemplary project will:

    have no bugs or errors
    be written in clear and well-formatted code with explanatory commenting and relevant id/class names throughout
    include techniques and HTML/CSS not explicitly covered in class


### Aesthetics.
An exemplary project will:

    have striking aesthetics that are unique to individual/team who created them
    use visual, audio, interactive and other aesthetics to reinforce the key concepts underlying the work
    have aesthetics that relate to the underlying technology specifically, leveraging its strengths and working with its weaknesses


### Process.
An exemplary project will include process documentation that:

    covers the entire process of conceptualisation, design, development, testing, and iteration
    includes multiple prototype versions of the project to demonstrate progression
    is richly diverse, including drawings, writing, diagrams, screenshots, audio clips, video, etc.


### Presentation.
An exemplary project will include a presentation that:

    addresses the guiding question critically, confidently, and with evidence drawn from multiple sources, including the project, prototypes, code, design documents, and references to the work of others
    is able to discuss how all elements of the project, from code to interaction design to visual aesthetics and more, are interwoven and related to one another
    flows from topic to topic and is clearly organised conceptually and technically

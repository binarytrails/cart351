cellauto.js
=====

cellauto.js is a library for creating cellular automata simulations in Javascript.  The library is tiny and
is pure Javascript, requiring no third party code to run in your browser.

See it run here on the [project page](http://sanojian.github.io/cellauto/)

Some of the API ideas were inspired by the excellent project, [terra](http://rileyjshaw.com/terra/)

The project is open-source and licensed under MIT.
